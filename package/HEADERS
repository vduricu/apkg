The main headers used by about.pkg file generator are:

	> SPK    (0)	- The default header used by the application. All the instructions
					  required for the package to be executed/installed/compiled are
				  	  specified in the instruction script.
	> SCPK   (1)	- The header used when the package is a core package for the system.
				  	  The content of this package may be a source, a library to be installed,
				  	  an installation script etc.
	> SDPK   (2)	- The header used when the package contains downloadable content.
				  	  The header defines 4 subheaders, one for each type of header that
				  	  defines a content type (core, runnable, installable or source).
				  	  The content to be downloaded will be contained in download.list.
	> SRPK   (3)	- The header used when the package contains runnable content. When an
				  	  application has runnable content, it may not be installed. If an
				  	  installation instruction is written in the instruction script, than
				  	  the package may be installed.
	> SIPK   (4)	- The header used when the package has an installable content. The
				  	  installation instruction are written in the instruction script.
	> SSPK   (5)	- The header used when the package has a source in its content. The
				  	  compilation + installation instruction are written in the instruction
				  	  script.
